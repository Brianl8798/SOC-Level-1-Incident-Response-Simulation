🔍 SOC Level 1 Incident Response Simulation
Hands-on threat analysis using TryHackMe’s SOC simulator

🚀 Overview

Completed TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1 simulation to:

✔ Triage real-world security alerts (phishing, brute force, malware)

✔ Investigate incidents using Splunk and Windows Event Logs

✔ Document findings and recommend mitigations

🛠️ Key Activities

Incident Type: Phishing Analysis, Brute Force Attack, Malware Execution

Tools Used: Email headers, URLScan, Splunk, Windows Logs, VirusTotal, ProcMon

Skills Demonstrated: Indentifying malicious links/attachments, KQL-style querying for failed logins, Process tree analysis & IOC extraction


🎯 Outcomes

Closed 8/10 incidents with accurate root cause analysis

Extracted 15+ IOCs (IPs, hashes, domains) for threat intel

Recommended mitigations:

Block malicious IPs at firewall

Implement MFA for exposed services

💡 Lessons Learned

"Documentation is as critical as detection – clear notes accelerated collaboration with L2 analysts."
